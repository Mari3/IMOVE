# ICA
BEP Interactive Crowd Art

This Repository contains the source and testing code of the I. M.O.V.E project. In this project we combine image processing, calibration techniques and computer graphics to create an interactive experience for the user, using a projector and a camera.
It also contains the Google test and fakeit source code until an alternative way of handling this is found. This code is _not_ written by us, it is just included to be used in testing.

## Applications

When building this project using cmake, several applications will be generated.

### imove
This is the main application. It processes the camera input and turns it into the graphics that are to be projected by the projector.

### calibration
This is used to calibrate the program, so that certain setup-specific variables, such as the location of the projection in the camera view, can be determined beforehand. 

### scene-integration
This is an integration test for the graphics part of the program. Used primarily in development to develop the graphics without having to deal with the other parts of the software.

### runMyTests
This executes the tests written using the Google Test framework and the fakeit mocking library. Also used only in development.

## Parts of imove

The imove application contains a few parts that contribute to the total. See the following high-level diagram and an explanation of each part.
![alt high-level-diagram](highleveldiagram.png)

### Calibration
This part is responsible for the processing of the configuration file generated by the 'calibration' application, and the use thereof.

### Image processing
The image processing part is responsible for spotting people in the image and identifying them. This part depends on the calibration part.

### Scene
The scene part is responsible for generating the graphics based on the people's locations.

### Interface
This part contains only the interface between the image processing and the scene, the Person class.
